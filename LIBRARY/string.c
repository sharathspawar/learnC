// Key Functions in <string.h>:

//     strlen(): Returns the length of a string.
//     strcpy(): Copies a string to another.
//     strncpy(): Copies up to n characters of a string.
//     strcat(): Appends one string to another.
//     strncat(): Appends up to n characters of a string.
//     strcmp(): Compares two strings lexicographically.
//     strncmp(): Compares up to n characters of two strings.
//     strchr(): Finds the first occurrence of a character in a string.
//     strrchr(): Finds the last occurrence of a character in a string.
//     strstr(): Finds the first occurrence of a substring.
//     strtok(): Tokenizes a string into a series of substrings.
//     memset(): Sets memory to a specific value.
//     memcpy(): Copies memory blocks.
//     memmove(): Moves memory blocks (safely when overlap occurs).




// Explanation:

//     strlen(): Returns the length of a string (not including the null terminator).
//     strcpy(): Copies the entire contents of one string to another, including the null terminator.
//     strncpy(): Copies up to n characters from one string to another, ensuring no overflow occurs.
//     strcat(): Appends the content of one string to another.
//     strncat(): Appends up to n characters of one string to another.
//     strcmp(): Compares two strings lexicographically. Returns a negative, zero, or positive value depending on whether the first string is lexicographically less than, equal to, or greater than the second string.
//     strncmp(): Compares the first n characters of two strings.
//     strchr(): Finds the first occurrence of a character in a string. Returns a pointer to the character, or NULL if not found.
//     strrchr(): Finds the last occurrence of a character in a string.
//     strstr(): Finds the first occurrence of a substring within a string.
//     strtok(): Tokenizes a string based on a set of delimiters. Returns each token in turn.
//     memset(): Sets the first n bytes of a memory block to a specified value.
//     memcpy(): Copies n bytes from one memory block to another.
//     memmove(): Similar to memcpy(), but handles memory overlap safely.

// Compilation and Execution:

// Save the code as string_demo.c, then compile it:

// gcc -o string_demo string_demo.c

// Run the program:

// ./string_demo

// Sample Output:

// Length of str2: 6
// After strcpy, str4: World!
// After strncpy, str4: This is
// After strcat, str1: Hello, World!
// After strncat, str1: Hello, World!This 
// strcmp result: -1
// strncmp result (first 5 characters): 0
// First occurrence of 'r' in str2: rld!
// Last occurrence of 'r' in str2: rld!
// First occurrence of 'string' in str5: string!
// First token from str6: apple
// Next token: banana
// Next token: orange
// After memset, buffer: **********
// After memcpy, str7: apple,banana,orange
// After memmove, str7: orange,banana,orange

// Notes:

//     strtok() modifies the string in place, so it is important to ensure that the string you pass to it is writable.
//     Memory Safety: Functions like strncpy(), memcpy(), and memmove() are more memory-safe versions of their counterparts (strcpy(), memmove()), but they require you to manage buffer sizes properly.





// The C code demonstrates a variety of string manipulation functions from the <string.h> library. These functions are essential for working with strings in C.

// 1. Includes:

// stdio.h: For standard input/output functions like printf.
// string.h: Provides the string manipulation functions.
// stdlib.h: Not directly used in the provided code.
// 2. String Declarations:

// Several character arrays (str1, str2, etc.) are initialized with various strings. Note that str4 is declared without an initial size; its size will be determined when it's used as the destination of strcpy or strncpy.

// 3. Demonstrated Functions:

// The code demonstrates the following functions with clear examples and output:

// strlen(str): Calculates the length of a string str.
// strcpy(dest, src): Copies the string src to dest. Make sure dest is large enough!
// strncpy(dest, src, n): Copies at most n characters from src to dest. Safer than strcpy as it helps prevent buffer overflows, but it might not null-terminate dest if src is longer than n. Always manually null-terminate if this is the case.
// strcat(dest, src): Appends src to the end of dest. dest needs to have enough space.
// strncat(dest, src, n): Appends at most n characters from src to the end of dest. Safer than strcat.
// strcmp(str1, str2): Compares str1 and str2 lexicographically. Returns 0 if they are equal, a negative value if str1 is less than str2, and a positive value if str1 is greater than str2.
// strncmp(str1, str2, n): Compares the first n characters of str1 and str2.
// strchr(str, char): Finds the first occurrence of char in str. Returns a pointer to the character or NULL if not found.
// strrchr(str, char): Finds the last occurrence of char in str.
// strstr(haystack, needle): Finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack.
// strtok(str, delimiters): Breaks str into a series of tokens based on the delimiters. Subsequent calls with str as NULL continue tokenizing the original string. Important: strtok modifies the original string.
// memset(ptr, value, num): Sets the first num bytes of the memory block pointed to by ptr to the value value.
// memcpy(dest, src, num): Copies num bytes from src to dest. Does not handle overlapping memory correctly; use memmove for that.
// memmove(dest, src, num): Copies num bytes from src to dest, handling overlapping memory regions correctly.
// This explanation focuses on the practical usage of each string function and emphasizes memory safety considerations where relevant. It also clarifies the purpose of the included headers and omits the unnecessary sample output and compilation instructions, which were present in the original comments. This keeps the explanation concise and focused on the code's functionality.

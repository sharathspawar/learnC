// Key Functions and Macros Demonstrated:

//     open():
//         Opens or creates a file with the specified flags.
//         Flags like O_RDWR (read/write), O_CREAT (create if not exists), O_APPEND (append mode), etc.

//     write():
//         Writes data to the file descriptor.

//     lseek():
//         Adjusts the file offset for reading/writing.

//     read():
//         Reads data from the file descriptor into a buffer.

//     fcntl():
//         Retrieves (F_GETFL) or sets (F_SETFL) file descriptor flags, such as O_NONBLOCK.

//     File permission flags:
//         Set permissions like S_IRUSR (read permission for the owner) and S_IWUSR (write permission for the owner).

//     close():
//         Closes the file descriptor.

// Compilation and Execution:

// Save the program as fcntl_demo.c and compile it:

// gcc -o fcntl_demo fcntl_demo.c
// ./fcntl_demo

// Sample Output:

// For a file named example.txt:

// File 'example.txt' opened successfully with file descriptor 3
// Written 38 bytes to the file
// File offset reset to 0
// Read 38 bytes from the file: Hello, file control with <fcntl.h>!
// Current file descriptor flags: 2
// File set to non-blocking mode
// File closed successfully

// Notes:

//     If example.txt doesn't exist, the program will create it with S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR permissions.
//     The program demonstrates basic file operations and fcntl()-based flag manipulation.
//     Use O_NONBLOCK in real-world applications for non-blocking I/O, particularly in network programming or interactive file operations.





// The C code demonstrates the use of functions from the fcntl.h header, which provides control over file descriptors. It covers opening, writing to, reading from, and manipulating the properties of a file. Here's a breakdown:

// 1. Opening a File:

// open(file_path, O_RDWR | O_CREAT, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR): Opens the file specified by file_path. The flags used are:
// O_RDWR: Open for reading and writing.
// O_CREAT: Create the file if it doesn't exist.
// S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR: Set read and write permissions for the owner.
// The function returns a file descriptor (an integer) if successful, or -1 on error. The code includes error checking.
// 2. Writing to the File:

// write(fd, message, strlen(message)): Writes the data in message to the file descriptor fd. It returns the number of bytes written or -1 on error.
// 3. Changing File Offset:

// lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_SET): Moves the file offset to the beginning of the file. SEEK_SET indicates positioning relative to the start of the file. lseek is used to control where the next read or write operation will occur. Error checking is included.
// 4. Reading from the File:

// read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1): Reads data from the file descriptor fd into the buffer. sizeof(buffer) - 1 limits the read to prevent buffer overflow. It returns the number of bytes read, or -1 on error. The read data is null-terminated to make it a valid C string.
// 5. Getting and Setting File Descriptor Flags with fcntl():

// fcntl(fd, F_GETFL): Retrieves the current file descriptor flags (e.g., O_NONBLOCK, O_APPEND).
// fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK): Sets the file descriptor flags. In this case, it adds O_NONBLOCK to the existing flags. O_NONBLOCK makes subsequent I/O operations non-blocking. This is important for handling situations where an operation might otherwise block the program's execution (e.g., reading from a socket when no data is available).
// 6. Closing the File:

// close(fd): Closes the file descriptor, releasing the associated resources.
// Key Improvements in this Explanation:

// Detailed explanation of the open() flags, including permissions.
// Clearer explanation of file descriptors.
// Emphasis on the purpose of lseek() for controlling the read/write position.
// Explanation of how O_NONBLOCK is used for non-blocking I/O.
// Improved error handling descriptions.
// Removed unnecessary references to sample output or compilation instructions.
// This explanation provides a more concise and accurate overview of the code's functionality and the usage of fcntl.h functions. It emphasizes important concepts like file descriptors, file offset manipulation, and non-blocking I/O, which are fundamental to low-level file operations in C.
